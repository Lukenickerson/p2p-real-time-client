# P2P Real-time Client

***An example of using the WebRTC browser functionality - via PeerJS - for peer-to-peer communication between browsers***

Right now this is equivalent of a "Hello World" for [PeerJS](https://peerjs.com/docs/#peer), and exists mainly for education. It's possible it could be expanded to be more a generic tool to include in other sites/apps.

Try it out: 
- https://lukenickerson.github.io/p2p-real-time-client/
- Open "Peer" windows in separate tabs
- Copy and past the peer ID from one window to another
- Then have them communicate
